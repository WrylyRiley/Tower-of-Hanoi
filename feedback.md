### 3: Excelling

Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

## Technical Requirements:

### 3: Excelling

Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

## Code Quality:

### 2: Progressing

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

## Creativity/Interface:

### 3: Excelling

Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

## Notes
Notes:
* Awesome job on this project! Great job using functions and classes to break down your code. I really like the use of CSS Grid!
* Your code overall looks really good and is pretty DRY! 
* I would maybe keep working on making Hanoi work on browsers of different sizes using media queries.
* Its awesome that you are using so many comments to flag what your code is doing. I do have a couple articles on what comments should look like in production:
    * https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/
    * https://css-tricks.com/the-art-of-comments/
* I wasn't able to figure out the issue with adding time between each disk moving. I think you may want to move to an iterative approach in order to get the timeouts in order, or separate the view code from the game logic and do the transformation after a timeout.

## Things you'd like specific feedback on: 

* Totally fine to use CSS Grid! It just isn't 100% supported by all browsers yet so it still throws that warning.
